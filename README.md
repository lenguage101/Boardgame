# Getting Started

Start by randomly generating the game map. <br />

On the map, there will be a limited number of weapons (up to 4) which will be placed randomly and can be collected by players who pass through. <br />

The default weapon which team players must inflict 10 points of damage. Each weapon has a name and associated visual. <br />

The placement of the two players is also randomly placed on the map when the game initates and will have at least one square between them. <br />


# Moving Players

For each turn, a player can move from one to three boxes either horizontally or vertically before ending their turn. 
However if a box is blacked and they will not be able to pass through directly. <br />

Should a player pas over a box containing a weapon, they will leave their current weapon on site and replace it with the updated one. <br />

# Fight!

If players cross over adjacent squares either horizontally or vertically, then the battle will commence. <br />

During combat, the game works is as follows: <br />

Each player attacks in turn <br/>

The damage depends on the player's weapon <br/> 

The player can choose to attack or defend against the next attack <br/>

If the player chooses to defend themselves, they sustain 50% less damage than normal <br/> 

As soon as the life points of a player (initially 100) falls to 0, they lose. A message appears and the game is over. <br/>

Best of luck to you future warriors!
